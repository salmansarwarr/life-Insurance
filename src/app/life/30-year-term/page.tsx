                    Term life insurance policies are perhaps the most common
                    form of life insurance, and they tend to have the most
                    competitive rates. But their affordability doesn't
                    necessarily mean they are less valuable for you. In fact,
                    term policies can offer higher coverage amounts than other
                    forms of life insurance.

                    Like all life insurance, term policies can help families and

                    dive into the strategies for using these policies, it's
                    essential to understand what they are.

                    policyholder passes away while the policy is in force.{" "}
                    <br /> <br /> A term policy is in force for the duration of
                    the "term," so long as the premiums are paid. This term is
                    decided at the time the policy is created. It's often done
                    in increments of ten, as in a 10-, 20-, or 30-year term life
                    policy. That means if the policy expires and the applicable
                    duration or term has completed, there won't be a payout. So,
                    while these policies are often less expensive than permanent
                    life insurance, the policyholder may outlive the policy.

                    Term life insurance often has more competitive rates than

                    the impermanent nature of term policies. Yet, these policies
                    are also usually cheaper because they often lack certain
                    features, like cash value (some permanent policies can
                    accrue value over time, some of which can be withdrawn
                    during the policyholder's lifetime). Monthly premiums for
                    people in their 20s and 30s acquiring a 30-year policy are
                    often under $100/month, with variance depending on the
                    amount of the death benefit. The affordability of term

                    Term life policies often have the best rates. The younger
                    and healthier you are when you begin the policy, the better
                    these rates are likely to be. It's common for term policies
                    to have fixed rates, so starting young and taking out a
                    30-year level term life insurance policy can help lock in
                    low rates for a long time. For this reason, 30-year life
                    insurance rates are often some of the most competitive.

                    include simplified and fully underwritten term life policies
                    for qualifying applicants. With a simplified policy, you'll
                    have a less rigorous application process, allowing for
                    greater access and a quicker application. Fully underwritten
                    policies involve a lengthier, more robust application
                    process but generally allow higher coverage limits. While
                    neither type requires medical exams for most applicants,
                    fully underwritten plans include some health questions to
                    help determine premium levels. <br /> <br /> If you're
